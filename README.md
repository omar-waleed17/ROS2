# ROS Training – Torpedo Technical Team

This repository contains ROS projects completed as part of the **Torpedo Technical Team training**, designed to help us learn and practice **ROS and ROS 2 concepts**.

## Workshop 1 – Ultrasonic Sensor Simulation

- **Publisher Node:** Generates and publishes simulated ultrasonic sensor data.  
- **Subscriber Node:** Subscribes to the sensor data and logs decisions based on the readings.  

This workshop demonstrates **data publishing, subscription, and decision-making** in ROS without requiring physical hardware.

## Spawn Turtle Catch Game (ROS 2)

- **Base Turtle Control:** Move the base turtle to chase spawned target turtles.  
- **Spawn Turtle Generation:** Spawn turtles at random positions in the workspace.  
- **Collision Detection:** Detect when the base turtle catches a spawned turtle.  
- **Turtle Destruction:** Remove caught turtles using a service.  

Through this game, we practiced implementing **multiple publishers and subscribers**, as well as **services**, reinforcing core ROS 2 concepts in an interactive way.
